			<p>This college-level course provides an opportunity for students to study rhetorical communication styles. Students who recognize when they are being manipulated by advertising or other types of persuasion, as well as students familiar with debate/mock trial/Model UN, will find their analytical instincts rewarded in AP Language. Much of the coursework entails a study of context, message, speaker, and audience. Students analyze issues and styles in media such as informative and satirical news articles, podcasts, social media posts, radio broadcasts, speeches, political/rhetorical debates, newsletters, film, documentaries, and landmark documents. Longer works or excerpts include the likes of Martin Luther King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Janisse Ray's <i>Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,</i> Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Outliers,</i> Annie Dillard's <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,</i> and George Orwell's <i>1984.</i> The main text, <i>50 Essays,</i> has many shorter works that students enjoy.  Students participate in informal debate and learn efficient and accurate research methods and oral communication skills. In the spring students do a unit on humor, which includes a class viewing of Buster Keaton's film, <i>The General,</i> a study of how humor is used in persuasion, and a group film project. AP Lang students often practice ways to make their own writing more effective, trying out a broad base of literary techniques used by master writers (devices such as anastrophe, analogy, and the powerful short sentence!). AP test practice prepares students to score well on the national AP Language exam given in May, which can provide college credit. AP test practice prepares students to score well on the national AP Language exam given in May, as well as the "new" SAT and ACT tests.
