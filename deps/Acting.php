      <p>One weekly 60-min class</p>

			<p>We will all <strong>sharpen our creativity</strong> by playing theatre games and developing spontaneous scenes based on improvised situations. Viola Spolin's improvisation techniques will make us more sensitive to how our senses interact with our surroundings. Robert Cohen's acting theory will lead us through the foundational concepts of victory, obstacle, and tactics where we will utilize content-less lines as well as scenes from traditional theatre. In addition, we will investigate common theatre practices such as blocking, eating stage food, faking fights, and staying in character. To build a good space to do all of this, we will build an environment where the introvert (your teacher) and the extrovert (you or your friends!) will each have a safe place to try new things. This will take <strong>cooperation, leadership, and organization</strong> which can all transfer to real life.</p>

      <p>Students will learn to work with a class contract to fulfill course objectives and determine the grade they want to achieve through not only attending classes regularly, but going to at least one professional production and reading two full-length play scripts per semester. Students will volunteer with set dressing, managing, or performing in the fall talent show as well as participating in another Eastside event in the spring.</p>
