    <p>This is a great class for those who normally don't enjoy literature: there is plenty of action in Anglo-Saxon, Medieval, and Renaissance works, for example. The lit survey covers historical works and authors that every student should be familiar with before graduation&mdash;from <em>Beowulf</em> to <em>Canterbury Tales</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>, and from Shakespeare to Moderns like Mary Shelley and T.S. Eliot.</p>

    <p>Students learn to read, analyze, and write about various styles of great literature, all of which were hits in their time period and are still wonderful stories today. Class discussions often lead into the "great world of ideas," and on-our-feet activities keep the class time moving and interactive. Role playing, illustrating, expressive reading, informal debate, and many types of group work add variety to text study. A mock trial of Victor Frankenstein is often one of spring's activities.</p>

    <p>Text: <em>England in Literature</em>, Scott Foresman, ISBN 0673129225. Digital copies are loaned out for the year in lieu of printed copies. Also, an unabridged copy of <em>Frankenstein</em> is needed in the spring.</p>

    <p>Optional reading can add extra credit and/or honors credit. See list and plan here: <a href="reading_list.html">Reading List</a></p>
