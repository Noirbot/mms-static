      <p>This seminar-style course provides an opportunity for students to dig into literature in an analytical way, writing about and discussing the content and context of classic works. Through study of writing techniques, literary terms, and backgrounds of literature from various centuries and cultures, students investigate literary analysis and learn to navigate through some of the powerful worldviews of history, from Greek to African to European, and from existentialist to feminist to Christian. Discussion, research, mapping, and analytical writing lead to drafts and revisions of essays and explications, and study of past AP exams makes the optional, national May exam more friendly to the student. Despite this serious description, students actually enjoy the give and take in the discussions and the chance to dig deeply into interesting material. Much of the class is interactive and hands-on. Optional summer reading can add extra credit and may cover August classwork if parents desire to start the course before Labor Day.
