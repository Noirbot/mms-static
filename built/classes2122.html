    <p>*Class may be renamed. Instructor can work with parents on requirements to fit transcript needs.</p><br />
    <p>Grades: 9-12</p> <br />
    <p>One core credit </p> <br />
    <p>DOE course codes: 23.06100, 23.06200, 23.06700* </p>
    <p>One 120-min class meets weekly and includes break times.</p>

    <p>This is a great class for students who think they don't like English classes, and/or students who are up for learning a variety of college and life skills in addition to traditional writing and reading. ML is an active class that takes place in an encouraging environment. The skills of literary analysis, writing, and speech are taught simultaneously since much of the structure and style of oral and written communication are complementary. </p>

    <p>Units of <b><em>literature</em></b> include short stories, poetry, drama, and visual media. Students investigate literary analysis skills one can build on for future college/AP classwork. Optional, extra-credit reading contributes to literature requirements if parents desire to start the course before school starts or fill in the school year with more reading during lengthy breaks in the calendar. This reading can continue throughout the year as extra credit, up to three books per semester, and could turn into "Honors" being added to the course name.</p>


    <p>The <b><em>composition</em></b> aspect of the course covers organization and editing skills needed for ACT essays, college/scholarship applications, discussion/exam-style essays, speaker analyses, resumes, job application prep, and other practical writing. Targeted grammar study is included in editing workshops, useful for those who have a mind for grammar and/or those with an ear for error correction. Teacher feedback in writing and speaking focuses on encouragement and "next steps" rather than punitive or negative assessment. Having said that, there is accountability for each student to grow and work toward his or her writing being able to match up with and exceed standard written English expectations. Students often upload writing assignments during the week via the Eastside website, making this a part-online/part-classroom experience. Students practice meeting deadlines and assignment details, with penalties (and rewards!) increasing over the semesters. Graded work is promptly sent home or posted at the course website for parent perusal. Spring projects include an MLA-style research paper on a career chosen by the student and a formal, persuasive speech.
    </p>

    <p>The <b><em>oral communication</em></b> aspect of ML starts with non-intimidating activities in an encouraging space nurtured carefully throughout the year. The goal is for students to have a supportive environment for exploring communication methods. The class progresses through gentle stages until basic solo speeches found in Speech 101 in most universities are presented, and life skills such as persuasive speaking and communicating in group settings are practiced. We also engage with job interview and nonverbal skill study culminating in time with visiting workplace professionals, as well as practicing small group roles and impromptu speaking. Students study design and use of various visual aids such as slides, posters, white board, and demonstration tools. </p>

    <p>Optional reading can add extra credit and/or honors credit. See list and plan here: <a href="reading_list.html">Reading List</a></p>

      <p>Grades: 10-12, 9 with permission</p> <br />
      <p>DOE course code: 23.06500 </p> <br />
      <p>One core credit </p> <br />
      <p>One weekly class with two 90-min periods</p>
      <p>Prerequisites: At least a B in two previous high-school-level English classes and motivation to do college-level work.</p>
      <br />

      <p>This seminar-style course provides an opportunity for students to dig into fiction in an analytical way, writing about and discussing the content and context of classic works. Through study of writing techniques, literary terms, and backgrounds of literature from various centuries and cultures, students investigate literary strategies and learn to navigate through some of the powerful worldviews of history, from Greek to African to European, and from existentialist to feminist to Christian. Students engage in discussion, research, and writing. Study of past AP exams makes the optional, national May exam more friendly to the student.</p>
      <p>Despite this serious description, students actually enjoy the give and take in the discussions and the chance to dig deeply into interesting material. Much of the class is interactive and hands-on. Optional summer reading can add extra credit, starting in summer.
          </p>

    <p>Grades: 10-12, 9 with permission of instructor </p> <br />

    <p>One core credit </p>  <br />
    <p>One weekly class with two 90-min sections</p><br />

    <p>This is a great class for those who normally don't enjoy literature: there is plenty of action in Anglo-Saxon, Medieval, and Renaissance works, for example. The lit survey covers historical works and authors that every student should be familiar with before graduation&mdash;from <em>Beowulf</em> to <em>Canterbury Tales</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>, and from Shakespeare to Moderns like Mary Shelley and T.S. Eliot.</p>

    <p>Students learn to read, analyze, and write about various styles of great literature, all of which were hits in their time period and are still wonderful stories today. Class discussions often lead into the "great world of ideas," and on-our-feet activities keep the class time moving and interactive. Role playing, illustrating, expressive reading, informal debate, and many types of group work add variety to text study. A mock trial of Victor Frankenstein is often one of spring's activities.</p>

    <p>Text: <em>England in Literature</em>, Scott Foresman, ISBN 0673129225. Digital copies are loaned out for the year in lieu of printed copies. Also, an unabridged copy of <em>Frankenstein</em> is needed in the spring.</p>

    <p>Optional reading can add extra credit and/or honors credit. See list and plan here: <a href="reading_list.html">Reading List</a></p>
