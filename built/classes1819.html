    <p>Grades: 10-12, 9 with permission of instructor </p> <br />
    <p>DOE course number: 23.05200</p>  <br />
    <p>One core credit </p>  <br />
    <p>One weekly class with two 90-min sections</p><br />

    <p>This is a great class for those who normally don't enjoy literature: there is plenty of action in Anglo-Saxon, Medieval, and Renaissance works, for example. The lit survey covers historical works and authors that every student should be familiar with before graduation&mdash;from <em>Beowulf</em> to <em>Canterbury Tales</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>, and from Shakespeare to Moderns like Mary Shelley and T.S. Eliot.</p>

    <p>Students learn to read, analyze, and write about various styles of great literature, all of which were hits in their time period and are still wonderful stories today. Class discussions often lead into the "great world of ideas," and on-our-feet activities keep the class time moving and interactive. Role playing, illustrating, expressive reading, informal debate, and many types of group work add variety to text study. A mock trial of Victor Frankenstein is often one of spring's activities.</p>

    <p>Text: <em>England in Literature</em>, Scott Foresman, ISBN 0673129225. Digital copies are loaned out for the year in lieu of printed copies. Also, an unabridged copy of <em>Frankenstein</em> is needed in the spring.</p>

    <p>Optional reading can add extra credit and/or honors credit. See list and plan here: <a href="reading_list.html">Reading List</a></p>

    <p>*Class may be renamed. Instructor can work with parents on requirements to fit transcript needs.</p><br />
    <p>Grades: 9-12</p> <br />
    <p>One core credit </p> <br />
    <p>DOE course codes: 23.05100, 23.06100, 23.06200, 23.06400, 23.06600, 23.06700* </p>
    <p>One 120-min class meets weekly and includes break times.</p>

    <p>This is a great class for students who think they don't like English classes, and/or students who are up for learning a variety of college and life skills in addition to traditional writing and reading. ML is an active class that takes place in an encouraging environment. The skills of literary analysis, writing, and speech are taught simultaneously since much of the structure and style of oral and written communication are complementary. </p>

    <p>Units of <b><em>literature</em></b> include short stories, poetry, drama, and visual media. Students investigate literary analysis skills one can build on for future college/AP classwork. Optional, extra-credit reading contributes to literature requirements if parents desire to start the course before school starts or fill in the school year with more reading during lengthy breaks in the calendar. This reading can continue throughout the year as extra credit, up to three books per semester, and could turn into "Honors" being added to the course name.</p>


    <p>The <b><em>composition</em></b> aspect of the course covers organization and editing skills needed for ACT essays, college/scholarship applications, discussion/exam-style essays, speaker analyses, resumes, job application prep, and other practical writing. Targeted grammar study is included in editing workshops, useful for those who have a mind for grammar and/or those with an ear for error correction. Teacher feedback in writing and speaking focuses on encouragement and "next steps" rather than punitive or negative assessment. Having said that, there is accountability for each student to grow and work toward his or her writing being able to match up with and exceed standard written English expectations. Students often upload writing assignments during the week via the Eastside website, making this a part-online/part-classroom experience. Students practice meeting deadlines and assignment details, with penalties (and rewards!) increasing over the semesters. Graded work is promptly sent home or posted at the course website for parent perusal. Spring projects include an MLA-style research paper on a career chosen by the student and a formal, persuasive speech.
    </p>

    <p>The <b><em>oral communication</em></b> aspect of ML starts with non-intimidating activities in an encouraging space nurtured carefully throughout the year. The goal is for students to have a supportive environment for exploring communication methods. The class progresses through gentle stages until basic solo speeches found in Speech 101 in most universities are presented, and life skills such as persuasive speaking and communicating in group settings are practiced. We also engage with job interview and nonverbal skill study culminating in time with visiting workplace professionals, as well as practicing small group roles and impromptu speaking. Students study design and use of various visual aids such as slides, posters, white board, and demonstration tools. </p>

    <p>Optional reading can add extra credit and/or honors credit. See list and plan here: <a href="reading_list.html">Reading List</a></p>

    <p>Required Text: Perrine's <em>Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense</em> (ISBN 0155511084), available used online or from previous ML and AP Lit students</p>

			<p>This college-level course provides an opportunity for students to encounter, analyze, and create rhetorical/persuasive communication styles and methods.</p>
      <p>Students who recognize when they are being manipulated by advertising or other types of persuasion, as well as students familiar with debate/mock trial/Model UN, will find their analytical instincts rewarded in AP Language. Much of the coursework entails a study of context, message, speaker, and audience. Students analyze issues and styles in media such as informative and satirical news articles, podcasts, social media posts, radio broadcasts, speeches, political/rhetorical debates, newsletters, film, documentaries, and landmark documents. The main text, <em>50 Essays,</em> has shorter works that students enjoy, many of which are by American writers for those who need American Lit credit. Longer works or excerpts include the likes of Martin Luther King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Shakespeare's <em>Julius Caesar,</em> Malcolm Gladwell's <em>Outliers,</em> Annie Dillard's <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,</em> and George Orwell's <em>1984.</em></p>

      <p>AP Language students often practice ways to make their own writing and speaking more effective, trying out a broad base of literary techniques used by master writers (devices such as anastrophe, analogy, and the powerful short sentence!). Class members participate in informal persuasive argument and learn efficient and accurate research methods and oral communication skills. When we study documentary under the direction of a digital media specialist, small groups create a film that pulls together a variety of data-collecting and editing techniques. Atlanta Shakespeare Company actors lead a lengthy workshop on directing and acting perspectives when we study Shakespeare plays. In addition, AP test practice prepares students to score well on the national AP Language exam given in May, which can provide college credit.</p>
