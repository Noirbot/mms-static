    <p>This is a great class for those who normally don't enjoy literature: there is plenty of action in Anglo-Saxon, Medieval, and Renaissance works, for example. The lit survey covers historical works and authors that every student should be familiar with before graduation&mdash;from <i>Beowulf</i> to <i>Canterbury Tales</i> to Wordsworth and T.S. Eliot. Students learn to read, analyze, and write about various styles of great literature, all of which were hits in their time and are still wonderful today. Class discussions often lead into the "great world of ideas," and on-our-feet activities keep the class time moving and interactive. Role playing, illustrating, intelligent games, videos, and group work add variety to text study. The mock trial of Victor Frankenstein is often one of spring's activities. A final research project focuses on a modern author chosen by individual students, who then get to practice creative, visual ways to teach the class themselves.

    <p>*Class may be renamed. Instructor can work with parents on requirements to fit transcript needs.</p><br />
    <p>Grades: 9-12</p> <br />
    <p>One core credit </p> <br />
    <p>DOE course codes: 23.06100, 23.06200, 23.06700* </p>
    <p>One 90-minute class, weekly </p>

    <p>This is a great class for students who think they don't like English classes, and/or students who are up for learning a variety of college and life skills in addition to traditional writing and reading. ML is an active class that takes place in an encouraging environment. The skills of literary analysis, writing, and speech are taught simultaneously since much of the structure and style of oral and written communication are complementary. </p>

    <p>Units of <b><i>literature</i></b> focus on short stories, poetry, drama, visual media, teacher handouts, and Internet resources. Major text is Perrine's <i>Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense</i> (ISBN 0155511084). Students are taught the rhetorical framework of fiction and nonfiction, investigating literary analysis skills one can build on for future AP classwork if desired. Optional, extra-credit summer reading can contribute to literature requirements and may cover August classwork if parents desire to start the course before Labor Day.</p>


    <p>The <b><i>composition</i></b> aspect of the course covers organization and editing skills needed for ACT and SAT essays, college/scholarship applications, discussion/exam-style essays, speaker analyses, resumes, article responses, resumes, and other practical writing. Targeted grammar study is included in editing workshops, useful for those who have a mind for grammar and/or those with an ear for error correction. Teacher feedback in writing and speaking focuses on encouragement and "next steps" rather than punitive or negative assessment. Having said that, there is accountability for each student to grow and work toward his or her writing being able to match up with standard written English. Students often turn in writing assignments during the week via email, making this a part-online/part-classroom experience. Students practice meeting deadlines and assignment details, with penalties (and rewards!) increasing over the semesters. Graded work is promptly sent home for parent perusal. Spring projects include an MLA-style research paper on a career chosen by the student and a formal, persuasive speech.
    </p>

    <p>The <b><i>oral communication</i></b> aspect of ML starts with non-intimidating assignments in order for students to build basic communication skills with a group, and comfort for themselves. The class progresses through stages until basic solo speeches found in Speech 101 in most universities are presented, and life skills such as persuasive speaking and communicating in group settings are practiced. We also practice job interview skills, non-verbal communication, small group consensus, and impromptu speaking. Students practice design and use of various visual aids such as PowerPoint, posters, white board, and demonstration tools.</p>

			<p>This college-level course provides an opportunity for students to study rhetorical communication styles. Students who recognize when they are being manipulated by advertising or other types of persuasion, as well as students familiar with debate/mock trial/Model UN, will find their analytical instincts rewarded in AP Language. Much of the coursework entails a study of context, message, speaker, and audience. Students analyze issues and styles in media such as informative and satirical news articles, podcasts, social media posts, radio broadcasts, speeches, political/rhetorical debates, newsletters, film, documentaries, and landmark documents. Longer works or excerpts include the likes of Martin Luther King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar,</i> Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Outliers,</i> Annie Dillard's <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,</i> and George Orwell's <i>1984.</i> The main text, <i>50 Essays,</i> has many shorter works that students enjoy.  Students participate in informal debate and learn efficient and accurate research methods and oral communication skills. AP Lang students often practice ways to make their own writing more effective, trying out a broad base of literary techniques used by master writers (devices such as anastrophe, analogy, and the powerful short sentence!). AP test practice prepares students to score well on the national AP Language exam given in May, which can provide college credit.
