    <p>Grades: 10-12, 9 with permission of instructor </p> <br />
    <p>DOE course number: 23.05200</p>  <br />
    <p>One core credit </p>  <br />
    <p>One weekly class at Eastside with two 90-min sections</p>

    <p>This is a great class for those who normally don't enjoy literature: there is plenty of action in Anglo-Saxon, Medieval, and Renaissance works, for example. The lit survey covers historical works and authors that every student should be familiar with before graduation&mdash;from <i>Beowulf</i> to <i>Canterbury Tales</i> to Wordsworth and T.S. Eliot. Students learn to read, analyze, and write about various styles of great literature, all of which were hits in their time and are still wonderful today. The three-hour class period enables students to enjoy some works that are lengthy and might otherwise be intimidating if a student sits at home alone, such as <i>Hamlet</i> or a British novel. Class discussions often lead into the "great world of ideas," and on-our-feet activities keep the class time moving and interactive. Videos, role playing, illustrating, intelligent games, and group work add variety to text study. The mock trial of Victor Frankenstein is often one of spring's activities. A final research project focuses on a modern author chosen by individual students, who then get to practice creative, visual ways to teach the class themselves.
    </p>
    <p>Text: <i>England in Literature</i>, Scott Foresman, ISBN 0673129225. Textbooks are borrowed from instructor with a refundable deposit, unless students want their own copies to write in (recommended for students who enjoy literature!).</p>

    <p>Optional summer reading can add extra credit and cover August classwork if parents desire to start the course before Labor Day.</p>

    <p>Learn about "Honors" option here: <a href="GeneralDoc/Honors Credit Directions 1718.pdf">Honors Details</a></p> <br/>
    <p>Grades: 9-12</p> <br />
    <p>One core credit </p> <br />
    <p>DOE course codes: 23.06100, 23.06200, 23.06700* </p>
    <p>One 90-minute class per week </p>

    <p>This is an active class that takes place in an encouraging environment. The skills of literary analysis, writing, and speech are taught simultaneously since much of the structure and style of oral and written communication are complementary. </p>

    <p>Units of <b><i>literature</i></b> focus on short stories, poetry, visual media, and nonfiction, including <i>Outcasts United</i> and <i>Oedipus Rex</i>, teacher handouts, Internet resources, and selected short stories and poems from Perrine's <i>Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense</i> (ISBN 0155511084). Students are taught the rhetorical framework of fiction and nonfiction, investigating literary analysis skills one can build on for future AP classwork if desired. Optional, extra-credit summer reading can contribute to literature requirements and may cover August classwork if parents desire to start the course before Labor Day.</p>


    <p>The <b><i>composition</i></b> aspect of the course covers organization and editing skills needed for ACT and SAT essays, college/scholarship applications, business letters, discussion/exam-style essays, speaker analyses, resumes, article responses, resumes, and other practical writing. Targeted grammar study is included in editing workshops, useful for those who have a mind for grammar and/or those with an ear for error correction. Teacher feedback in writing and speaking focuses on encouragement and "next steps" rather than punitive or negative assessment. Having said that, there is accountability for each student to grow and work toward his or her writing being able to match up with standard written English. Students often turn in writing assignments during the week via email, making this a part-online/part-classroom experience. Students practice meeting deadlines and assignment details, with penalties (and rewards!) increasing over the semesters. Graded work is promptly sent home for parent perusal. Spring projects include an MLA-style research paper on a career chosen by the student and a formal, persuasive speech.
    </p>

    <p>The <b><i>oral communication</i></b> aspect of ML starts with non-intimidating assignments in order for students to build basic communication skills with a group, and comfort for themselves. The class progresses through stages until basic solo speeches found in Speech 101 in most universities are presented, and life skills such as persuasive speaking and communicating in group settings are practiced. We also practice job interview skills, non-verbal communication, small group consensus, and impromptu speaking. Students practice design and use of various visual aids such as PowerPoint, posters, white board, and demonstration tools.</p>

      <p>One core credit </p> <br />

      <p>Prerequisites: At least a C in two previous high-school level English classes and motivation to do college-level work.</p>
      <br />

      <p>This seminar-style course provides an opportunity for students to dig into literature in an analytical way, writing about and discussing the content and context of classic literature. Through study of writing techniques, literary terms, and backgrounds of literature from various centuries and cultures, students investigate literary analysis and learn to navigate through some of the powerful worldviews of history, from Greek to African to Russian, and from existentialist to feminist to Christian. Discussion, research, mapping, and analytical writing lead to drafts and revisions of essays and explications, and study of past AP exams makes the optional, national May exam more friendly to the student. Despite this serious description, students actually enjoy the give and take in the discussions and the chance to dig deeply into interesting material. Much of the class is interactive and hands-on. Optional summer reading can add extra credit and may cover August classwork if parents desire to start the course before Labor Day.
          </p>

      <p>Texts: Perrine's <i>Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense</i> (ISBN 0155511084) and classic literature such as
