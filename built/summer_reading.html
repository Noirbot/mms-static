                              This list started as a record of many books my family read out loud to each other. Over several years I have added more, all the while trying to choose those with redemptive themes.

                                Books are chosen for their interest and integrity; many are nonfiction and have been tested on students and found by them to be well worth their time. Students starting class in the fall can enter with up to three hundred points of credit to be added into their first semester scores.

                                TO GET CREDIT: Please drop me an email and let me know when you have completed a book. We&#39;ll set up a few minutes to discuss the book by phone and I&#39;ll give you an excellent grade to start your fall semester. It&#39;s easy! Be in touch by email <a href="mailto:shumanhw@gmail.com">shumanhw@gmail.com</a> or phone 678-772-1644 any time.

                            <dt><em>Black Count, The</em> by Tom Reiss <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Tom Reiss tells a story of General Alexander Dumas, who served with honor in the French Revolution though he was the son of a black slave and born in Haiti. Dumas's son went on to write The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers, basing many exciting scenes on the real adventures of his father. Reiss writes that the general "rose higher in the white world than any man of his race would before our time" before he met an enemy he could not defeat . . . . This newly researched book is a good read for those who like true adventure stories.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, The</em> by William Kamkwamba <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>You will like this book if you like TED talks and STEM classes, if you are interested in African life today (this takes place in Malawi), or you just like an amazing story about a student your age. The son of Christian parents, William is like my step-son Kris; he always has bolts and washers and bits of this and that in his pockets, and loves to see how things work. How can someone like this change a whole village, and maybe a whole country?</dd>
                            <dt><em>Chosen, The</em> by Chaim Potok <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>This friendship story of two Jewish boys in Brooklyn near the end of WW2 reveals different perspectives of two devout groups regarding what was next for the forming of a Jewish nation. I learned much about discussions in this faith as well as life at this time of history, thanks to Chaim Potok who is a rabbi as well as popular American author.</dd>
                            <dt><em>City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World's Largest Refugee Camp</em> by Ben Rawlence <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd><em>City of Thorns</em> is a nonfiction account of the plight of half a million people who live in Dadaab, a 30-square-mile make-shift city in the desert of Kenya. Unable to legally work or build permanent homes, residents of Dadaab have resorted to a hard life for almost 30 years. Excellent read for anyone working with refugees in Clarkston or elsewhere.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Daughters of Islam</em> by Miriam Adeney <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Though I have read a number of books about Middle Eastern life and perspectives, this one was particularly helpful since it challenged some of my cookie-cutter ideas of what "missions" means. I believe it helpful for Christian women wanting to understand and communicate with Muslim neighbors.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Death of a King: The Real Story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Final Year</em> by Tavis Smiley <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Dr. King's usual biographical material is pulled from his "I have a dream" time period, but much went on in his last year of life that has not been told. Smiley writes a well researched and interesting chronology of the last 12 months, giving dignity to King's final vision and purpose.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Endurance</em> by Alfred Lansing <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>This is the story of Ernest Shackelton&#39;s survival as his trip across Antarctica goes against his plan. An eventful tale of 28 men and their various motivations to stay alive, and a beautiful account of a cold wasteland. Lansing&#39;s most famous book has scenes you will not forget. A book the Shumans read out loud with each other.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Extraordinary, Ordinary People</em> by Condoleezza Rice <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Former Secretary of State and first black woman to hold that office, Condoleezza Rice tells her story about growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Civil Rights era. High school students would appreciate her inside looks into political office, attending and teaching at Stanford University, and foreign policy.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Faithful Women and Their Extraordinary God</em> by No&euml;l Piper <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Five rather short but well-written bios of historic and contemporary women from various cultures: Sarah Edwards, Lilias Trotter, Gladys Aylward, Esther Ahn Kim, and Helen Roseveare. My husband couldn&#39;t help reading the last chapter out loud. The author tells their stories and then gives her own brief take-aways.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Gifted Hands</em> by Ben Carson and Cecil Murphy <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Once on everyone&#39;s reading list, this book belongs on ours. I recently reread it in two days because it was so interesting, and I loved the details of this neurosurgeon&#39;s life. Even though I&#39;m queasy and uneducated about medical procedures, the back chapters&#39; explanations of surgeries are understandable and exciting. Good book for family reading. </dd>
                            <dt><em>Hard Times</em> by Charles Dickens <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>A shorter Dickens novel. One of my friends really likes this one, so I started it three times. This summer's road trip was the winning situation; I listened to a library copy with reader Patrick Tull. This time I could follow who was who because Tull has a voice for everyone, and keeps the story going. The tale is a sometimes-dark fight between the idea that all we need for understanding are facts/science/math and the idea that imagination/the arts/wonder/questioning are intrinsic to a worthwhile life. Try this with the audio, at least to get started. I finished by reading pages, and really enjoyed the book and message. </dd>
                            <dt><em>I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban</em> by Malala Yousafzai <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>If you have not heard of this young woman, who turned 18 in July 2015, you can skim her Wiki bio. What she tells of her family's struggles in Pakistan gives a view of what has been happening in the Middle East in the last few years. She published a new prologue in June 2015. I learned from this smart young author who does not whine as she tells her story. </dd>
                            <dt><em>It&#39;s a Jungle Out There, Life Is a Jungle,</em> and <em>Jungle Calls</em> by Ron Snell <strong>(200 pts for all 3)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Nonfiction stories my family has read out loud three times now, laughing sometimes while amazed at what two brothers learn in their rainforest life and trips back to the States. This is an autobiographical account of a missionary kid and his brother growing up in Peru with a "risk-everything," ex-military father and a careful mom. These are fast-moving adventures that continue through Ron&#39;s college days in Chicago ("snakes in the dorm" and other great stories). </dd>
                            <dt><em>Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina</em> by Misty Copeland <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd><em>Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina</em> - Misty Copeland, the American Ballet Theatre's first black principal dancer, tells of her challenge to move from a child of little privilege on through the hard choices that led her to the ABT. Very readable for those who are curious about the life of a professional ballerina or who wonder how Copeland persevered as an African American in a traditionally white field.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Othello, Taming of the Shrew, Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Tempest</em> by Shakespeare <strong>(75 pts each)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Grab some friends and read these aloud? Take your time and use a Folger edition if possible to have summaries and footnotes available. Watch for quotable quotes and timeless themes. Listen along with an audio version if you wish. </dd>
                            <dt><em>One Thousand Gifts</em> by Ann Voskamp <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Hard to find good things to think about when you are angry? Mrs. Voskamp&#39;s journal-style writing deals honestly with her disappointments with God, even the death of her sister. Her beautiful writing style includes original words (Gerard Manley Hopkins comes to mind) and juxtaposed tones as she finds joy as a young Christian wife and mother on a Canadian farm.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Oswald Chambers: Abandoned to God</em> by David Macasland <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>A real surprise for me! I expected an elder-statesman type of man, but found a young man talented in the arts, who focused his life and went for what was important to him in his search for truth. Brings new energy to the devotions my family often reads.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Outliers</em> by Malcolm Gladwell <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>One out of a best-selling series of Gladwell books; this one looks at what creates success based on empirical data and observation. You&#39;ll be surprised at the interesting examples, from hockey stars to plane crashes to feuding families in Kentucky and lawyers in Manhattan. Quite readable - we read it on a family trip. </dd>
                            <dt><em>Places in Between, The</em> by Rory Stewart <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Stewart&#39;s nonfiction account of a journalist&#39;s walk across Afghanistan without the protection of his Western identity. Even if you have read only a little about the Middle East, this will inform and intrigue you. Includes a dog story and sketches by the author, too. There is a quite small amount of "language."</dd>
                            <dt><em>Rebel with a Cause</em> by Franklin Graham <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Franklin Graham&#39;s very readable autobiography. It was hard for Franklin to find his own life in the shadow of a "Christian Great" such as his father, Rev. Billy Graham. A famous traveling father and a determined and creative mom make for quite a set of boundaries for a young man too rebellious for his own safety! Graham&#39;s story continues through the beginnings of Samaritan&#39;s Purse. Hard not to share some of this with your family....</dd>
                            <dt><em>There Is No Me Without You</em> by Melissa Faye Green <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Nonfiction read that blends history, medical research, personal account, and biography to tell the story of an African woman&#39;s involvement in the growing orphan crisis in Ethiopia, and what we can do about it. Author is from Decatur - very readable and personal in approach. Another book the Shumans read out loud.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Screwtape Letters, The</em> by C. S. Lewis <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Take your time with this series of letters from a Satanic, fallen angel to his fledgling assistant who is charged with making a new believer fail. It&#39;s short, but its fantastic concept of evil vs. good will leave you re-thinking what tempts Christians to fall as well as survive in a world designed by a good God. </dd>
                            <dt><em>Till We Have Faces</em> by C. S. Lewis <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd><em>Till We Have Faces</em> is the last novel that Lewis wrote before his death, and is a fantasy story of friendship and faith. My students usually like the story, but are lost on the overall relevancy to Lewis's faith.

                            <dt><em>Bend, Not Break</em> by Ping Fu <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Ping Fu grew up during the Cultural Revolution in China. I didn&#39;t know anything about this time period before reading the book, but was really caught up in her story, which is rather like a dystopia at first (think The Giver or 1984, but her story is true!). Today Ms. Fu leads a 3-D printing corporation she began here in the US, with a life in serious contrast to her incredible past growing up being indoctrinated into the Revolution&#39;s crazy world.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Black Count, The</em> by Tom Reiss <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>

The son of Christian parents, William is like my step-son Kris; he always has bolts and washers and bits of this and that in his pockets, and loves to see how things work.

                            <dt><em>Boy Who Invented Television, The</em> by Paul Schatzkin <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>If you like the concept of inventing something no one else could figure out as well as you (even at age 14), you will like this account of how Phil Farnsworth could "see" how to build a television. Sending sound through radio waves was one thing, but to send pictures into receivers elsewhere was puzzling great scientists around the world. Phil, growing up in the country, looked at how he plowed a field in order to get a vision for how to transmit such a picture. This biography takes you through the science, the high points, and the struggles of a brilliant man who even figured out fusion in his day, though his plans are now lost.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky <strong>(200 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Everyone I know who has read this book has believed it worth his time. Good theme of redemption.

The Wall Street Journal counted it first in a list of crime thrillers.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Chosen, The</em> by Chaim Potok <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>This friendship story of two Jewish boys in Brooklyn near the end of WW2 reveals different perspectives of two devout groups regarding what was next for the forming of a Jewish nation. I learned much about discussions in this faith as well as life at this time of history, thanks to Chaim Potok who is a rabbi as well as popular American author.</dd>
                            <dt><em>City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World's Largest Refugee Camp</em> by Ben Rawlence <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd><em>City of Thorns</em> is a nonfiction account of the plight of half a million people who live in Dadaab, a 30-square-mile make-shift city in the desert of Kenya. Unable to legally work or build permanent homes, residents of Dadaab have resorted to a hard life for almost 30 years. Excellent read for anyone working with refugees in Clarkston or elsewhere.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Daughters of Islam</em> by Miriam Adeney <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Though I have read a number of books about Middle Eastern life and perspectives, this one was particularly helpful since it challenged some of my cookie-cutter ideas of what "missions" means. I believe it helpful for Christian women wanting to understand and communicate with Muslim neighbors.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Death of a King: The Real Story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Final Year</em> by Tavis Smiley <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Dr. King's usual biographical material is pulled from his "I have a dream" time period, but much went on in his last year of life that has not been told. Smiley writes a well researched and interesting chronology of the last 12 months, giving dignity to King's final vision and purpose.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Endurance</em> by Alfred Lansing <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>This is the story of Ernest Shackelton&#39;s survival as his trip across Antarctica goes against his plan. An eventful tale of 28 men and their various motivations to stay alive, and a beautiful account of a cold wasteland. Lansing&#39;s most famous book has scenes you will not forget. A book the Shumans read out loud with each other.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Extraordinary, Ordinary People</em> by Condoleezza Rice <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Former Secretary of State and first black woman to hold that office, Condoleezza Rice tells her story about growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Civil Rights era. High school students would appreciate her inside looks into political office, attending and teaching at Stanford University, and foreign policy.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Faithful Women and Their Extraordinary God</em> by No&euml;l Piper <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Five rather short but well-written bios of historic and contemporary women from various cultures: Sarah Edwards, Lilias Trotter, Gladys Aylward, Esther Ahn Kim, and Helen Roseveare. My husband couldn&#39;t help reading the last chapter out loud. The author tells their stories and then gives her own brief take-aways.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Farming of Bones, The</em> by Edwidge Danticat <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Set in the Dominican Republic and Haiti in 1937. Women might be more comfortable readers of this novel. Though I try to keep summer reading positive, the struggle of Haitians in this time is worth knowing. If you have worked with refugees in Atlanta, you might be up for walking with Amabelle through her difficult story.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Gifted Hands</em> by Ben Carson and Cecil Murphy <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Once on everyone&#39;s reading list, this book belongs on ours. I recently reread it in two days because it was so interesting, and I loved the details of this neurosurgeon&#39;s life. Even though I&#39;m queasy and uneducated about medical procedures, the back chapters&#39; explanations of surgeries are understandable and exciting. Good book for family reading. </dd>
                            <dt><em>Hard Times</em> by Charles Dickens <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>A shorter Dickens novel. One of my friends really likes this one, so I started it three times. This summer's road trip was the winning situation; I listened to a library copy with reader Patrick Tull. This time I could follow who was who because Tull has a voice for everyone, and keeps the story going. The tale is a sometimes-dark fight between the idea that all we need for understanding are facts/science/math and the idea that imagination/the arts/wonder/questioning are intrinsic to a worthwhile life. Try this with the audio, at least to get started. I finished by reading pages, and really enjoyed the book and message. </dd>
                            <dt><em>I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban</em> by Malala Yousafzai <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>If you have not heard of this young woman, who turned 18 in July 2015, you can skim her Wiki bio. What she tells of her family's struggles in Pakistan gives a view of what has been happening in the Middle East in the last few years. She published a new prologue in June 2015. I learned from this smart young author who does not whine as she tells her story. </dd>
                            <dt><em>It&#39;s a Jungle Out There, Life Is a Jungle,</em> and <em>Jungle Calls</em> by Ron Snell <strong>(150 pts for all; they are not long.)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Nonfiction stories my family has read out loud three times now, laughing sometimes while amazed at what two brothers learn in their rainforest life and trips back to the States. This is an autobiographical account of a missionary kid and his brother growing up in Peru with a "risk-everything," ex-military father and a careful mom. These are fast-moving adventures that continue through Ron&#39;s college days in Chicago ("snakes in the dorm" and other great stories). </dd>
                            <dt><em>Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina</em> by Misty Copeland <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd><em>Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina</em> - Misty Copeland, the American Ballet Theatre's first black principal dancer, tells of her challenge to move from a child of little privilege on through the hard choices that led her to the ABT. Very readable for those who are curious about the life of a professional ballerina or who wonder how Copeland persevered as an African American in a traditionally white field.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Othello, Taming of the Shrew, Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Tempest</em> by Shakespeare <strong>(75 pts each)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Grab some friends and read these aloud? Take your time and use a Folger edition if possible to have summaries and footnotes available. Watch for quotable quotes and timeless themes. Listen along with an audio version if you wish. </dd>
                            <dt><em>One Thousand Gifts</em> by Ann Voskamp <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Hard to find good things to think about when you are angry? Mrs. Voskamp&#39;s journal-style writing deals honestly with her disappointments with God, even the death of her sister. Her beautiful writing style includes original words (Gerard Manley Hopkins comes to mind) and juxtaposed tones as she finds joy as a young Christian wife and mother on a Canadian farm. </dd>
                            <dt><em>Oswald Chambers: Abandoned to God</em> by David Macasland <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>A real surprise for me! I expected an elder-statesman type of man, but found a young man talented in the arts, who focused his life and went for what was important to him in his search for truth. Brings new energy to the devotions my family often reads.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Outcasts United</em> by Warren St. John <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>How do you coach a soccer team that speaks many languages, and has no place to practice? This is the readable story of a town, a group of refugees, and a soccer coach who gave up her family&#39;s expectations in order to make a difference in the lives of some kids in Clarkston, GA. Required reading for freshmen at GA State and GA Tech a few years ago.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Outliers</em> by Malcolm Gladwell <strong>(100 pts; BL only)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>One out of a best-selling series of Gladwell books; this one looks at what creates success based on empirical data and observation. You&#39;ll be surprised at the interesting examples, from hockey stars to plane crashes to feuding families in Kentucky and lawyers in Manhattan. Required for AP Language, so if you plan to take that class, choose another now? </dd>
                            <dt><em>Places in Between, The</em> by Rory Stewart <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Stewart&#39;s nonfiction account of a journalist&#39;s walk across Afghanistan without the protection of his Western identity. Even if you have read only a little about the Middle East, this will inform and intrigue you. Includes a dog story and sketches by the author, too. There is a quite small amount of "language."</dd>
                            <dt><em>Rebel with a Cause</em> by Franklin Graham <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Franklin Graham&#39;s very readable autobiography. It was hard for Franklin to find his own life in the shadow of a "Christian Great" such as his father, Rev. Billy Graham. A famous traveling father and a determined and creative mom make for quite a set of boundaries for a young man too rebellious for his own safety! Graham&#39;s story continues through the beginnings of Samaritan&#39;s Purse. Hard not to share some of this with your family.... </dd>
                            <dt><em>Screwtape Letters, The</em> by C. S. Lewis <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Take your time with this series of letters from a Satanic, fallen angel to his fledgling assistant who is charged with making a new believer fail. It&#39;s short, but its fantastic concept of evil vs. good will leave you re-thinking what tempts Christians to fall as well as survive in a world designed by a good God.</dd>
                            <dt><em>There Is No Me Without You</em> by Melissa Faye Green <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Nonfiction read that blends history, medical research, personal account, and biography to tell the story of an African woman&#39;s involvement in the growing orphan crisis in Ethiopia, and what we can do about it. Author is from Decatur - very readable and personal in approach. Another book the Shumans read out loud.</dd>
                            <dt><em>Till We Have Faces</em> by C. S. Lewis <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd><em>Till We Have Faces</em> is the last novel that Lewis wrote before his death, and is a fantasy story of friendship and faith. My students usually like the story, but are lost on the overall relevancy to Lewis's faith. Please email me for useful, brief, explanatory notes! <a href="mailto:Shumanhw@gmail.com">Shumanhw@gmail.com</a></dd>
                            <dt><em>Unashamed</em> by Lecrae Moore <strong>(100 pts)</strong></dt>
                            <dd>Learn the engaging backstory of rap​per and Grammy-winning artist Lecrae. He has a long struggle to faith in Christ, and eventually finds clear answers to many questions: Why even be a Christian? What does it mean for a Christian to affect culture? Why bother being in culture, when there is a Christian audience one could make happy?</dd>
